//  Removing the free camera's leash
// =============================================================================
//  camReplayDirector::GetMaxDistanceAllowedFromPlayer() is the single source of
//  truth for how far the editor free camera may travel. Everything downstream
//  reads it:
//
//    camReplayFreeCamera::IsPositionOutsidePlayerLimits()  — the test itself
//    camReplayFreeCamera::SetToSafePosition()              — yanks you back in
//    camReplayDirector::Update()                           — swaps to the
//                                                            recorded camera
//    EDIT_WARNING_OUT_OF_RANGE                             — the UI toast
//    the boundary-sphere renderer
//
//  So one return value governs the whole limitation, and overriding it is far
//  safer than neutering each consumer.
//
//  Note the metadata route exists too — m_MaxCameraDistanceFromPlayer lives at
//  metadata+0x38 and is editable in cameras.ymt — but that field's own range
//  limit stops well short of what we want, and going through the hook keeps
//  this independent of the ymt.

	//  camReplayFreeCamera::UpdateZoom, as disassembled at Legacy 0x2AD21C:
	//
	//      mov   rax, [rcx+0x250]        ; this->m_Metadata
	//      movss xmm2, [rax+0x170]       ; m_MaxFov
	//      divss xmm3, [rcx+0x90]        ; zoomFactor    = MaxFov / m_Frame.fov
	//      divss xmm5, [rax+0x16c]       ; maxZoomFactor = MaxFov / m_MinFov
	//      ...   Clamp(zoomFactor, 1.0f, maxZoomFactor)
	//      divss xmm2, xmm3              ; newFov = MaxFov / zoomFactor
	//      ...   Clamp(newFov, 1.0f, 130.0f)   <- camFrame::SetFov, inlined
	//      movss [rcx+0x90], xmm2
	//
	//  So the reachable range IS MinFov..MaxFov, and widening the pair is the
	//  entire fix. Two consequences worth knowing:
	//
	//    - The view does not jump. Both the zoomFactor going in and the FOV
	//      coming out are scaled by the same MaxFov within one call, so it
	//      cancels; only the reachable ends move.
	//    - 1..130 is the ceiling. That last clamp is camFrame::SetFov and is
	//      shared with every camera in the game, so it is deliberately not
	//      patched.
	//
	//  The offsets are hardcoded because they were read straight out of both
	//  binaries, not guessed:
	//    Legacy   0x2AD21C  UpdateZoom standalone, exactly as listed above.

	//  The companion to the distance leash above. Lifting the leash lets the
	//  camera go; it does not tell the WORLD that the camera went. Every system
	//  that decides what to keep at full detail takes its centre from
	//  CFocusEntityMgr, whose default is the player ped:
	//
	//    CStreaming::Update           IPL cull boxes, zoned assets, managed IMAP
	//                                 groups, the map-data box streamer
	//    CSceneStreamerMgr            the spherical HD/LOD streamer position
	//    fwBoxStreamer                static collision and navmesh
	//    CPedPopulation               where ambient peds and vehicles belong
	//    CPedAILodManager             which peds get full AI and animation
	//
	//  So flying two kilometres out leaves you looking at a world that is still
	//  being streamed for somebody standing where you started. That is the LOD
	//  pop and the missing map the leash's own comment warns about, and this is
	//  the fix for it rather than a workaround.
	//
	//  HOW, and why it is one bit rather than a hook. Once per frame the camera
	//  interface caches the frame that was actually rendered, and checks this bit
	//  on it: set, and it hands that frame's position and velocity to the focus
	//  manager; clear, and - if it was the one overriding - it puts the focus back
	//  to the default. Both halves live in that one place, which is what makes the
	//  bit sufficient on its own.
	//
	//  Setting that flag is exactly what camSwitchCamera and the game's own
	//  debug free camera do, so this asks for a supported behaviour through its
	//  own switch instead of writing the focus manager behind its back - and the
	//  velocity the streamer prefetches along comes out right, which it would
	//  not if we wrote a position on our own.
	//
	//  WHERE. The frame this writes to is the director's m_PostEffectFrame, the
	//  one camBaseDirector::BaseUpdate clones out to the gameplay frame moments
	//  later. camReplayDirector::PostUpdate re-clones it from m_Frame at the top
	//  of every tick, so the bit never accumulates and never has to be cleared:
