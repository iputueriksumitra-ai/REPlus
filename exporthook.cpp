// =============================================================================
//  Export -> image sequence
// =============================================================================
//  The editor's Export button ends up in CVideoEditorUi::TriggerExport, which
//  calls CVideoEditorPlayback::Open(PLAYBACK_TYPE_BAKE). Bake is the game's own
//  encoder path: its codec, its watermark, its profanity check.
//
//  We intercept that single call and rewrite the argument to
//  PLAYBACK_TYPE_PREVIEW_FULL_PROJECT, so Export opens an ordinary full-project
//  playback instead, and the image-sequence renderer drives it.
//
//  Why one argument rather than menu rows: the export screen is built by
//  CVideoEditorMenu from R*'s own menu metadata, and its input handler indexes
//  that array. Rows we drew would not exist in it, so focus and TriggerAction
//  would run off the end. Rewriting an argument touches none of that - the menu
//  is untouched and keeps working exactly as shipped.
// =============================================================================
