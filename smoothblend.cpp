		//
		// Placed BEFORE the orientation block on purpose - that one returns early

		// MONOTONE rather than Catmull-Rom, and this is the one channel where the
		// difference is worth seeing: a Catmull-Rom through 50 -> 30 degrees can
		// dip below 30 and come back, which on a zoom reads as a wobble at the end
		// of the move. pchip cannot overshoot by construction, and it still
		// interpolates the knots exactly, so the FOV is the authored value at each
		// keyframe at the right moment.
		//
		// Marker FOV is a u8 in WHOLE DEGREES (+0xA3, cast straight to float and
		// clamped 1..130 by the game - confirmed in the marker->frame setup at leg

		// roughly (speed / segment length). Position does not care - the
		// |dC/du| cancels, which is the entire point of reparameterising by
		// arc length - but anything ELSE driven by the same u inherits the
		// ratio directly. Between a 10 m segment and a 40 m one, du/dt steps by
		// 4x at the marker, so the camera turns four times faster on one side
		// of the keyframe than the other. A driving shot hides it behind the
		// vehicle's own motion; a static one does not, which is exactly where
		// it was caught.
		//
		// An explicit ease is the one case where following the motion rather
		// than the clock IS wanted - the camera accelerates out of the keyframe
		// and the framing should go with it - and it does not bring the kick
		// back, because an ease ramp has zero derivative at both ends, so two
		// eased segments meet at a matched rate instead of a mismatched one.
		// The same eased clock the position now uses. This used to compute its own
