//  Is the replay heap already committed by the time we get here?
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Under FiveM the answer decides whether long recordings are reachable AT ALL.
//  Recording length is a memory budget out of one 172 MB pool, and widening that
//  pool means editing the size immediate BEFORE the allocation runs. On the
//  normal start path we are early enough. Under FiveM we are not: init is handed
//  to ScriptHookV, whose script thread did not run until 35 seconds after attach
//  in testing, by which point the pool is long since committed and the block
//  count clamps back to stock.
//
//  So the real question is whether there is a window between DLL attach and that
//  allocation. This answers it and nothing else - it is READ-ONLY on purpose.
//  Building the early-patch path before knowing the window exists would be
//  writing code that cannot work.
//
//  Deliberately free of the CRT. memory::scan opens with a function-local static
//  lambda and a std::vector, and a function-local static is exactly what faulted
//  inside msvcp140 when an earlier attempt ran the install from this thread (see
//  the note on FiveMRegisterThread). Everything here is stack arrays, raw loops
//  and WinAPI, so there is no static-init guard to trip.
