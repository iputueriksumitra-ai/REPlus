	// --- image sequence render ------------------------------------------------
	// Persisted like everything else, so a render setup survives a restart -
	// these are shot settings, not scratch state, and re-dialling them every
	// session would be the most annoying thing about the feature.
	// Defaults are a baked 360-degree shutter at 30fps: 64 sub-frames averaged
	// per output frame. Expensive - 64 captures per frame - but it is what the
	// footage actually wants, and the result is a real accumulation blur rather
	// than a screen-space approximation.
	//
	// Highlight boost is high for the same reason. A plain average of 64 samples
	// pulls every specular hit down towards the mean, so highlights that should
	// streak end up as grey mush; lifting them during accumulation keeps the
	// streak bright the way film does. It matters more the more samples you
	// take, which is exactly this configuration.
	//
	// 0.90 rather than the 0.99 this used to ship with - backed off the cap by
	// preference after looking at real output. The lift happens inside the
	// capture addon, not here; this value is only passed through, so treat the
	// two numbers as a taste setting rather than as a formula with a right
	// answer.
	// Which renderer drives the capture.
	//
	//   0 WALKING  - pause, seek to each sub-sample time, grab, average. Exact
	//                shutter, deterministic frame times, and the simpler
	//                failure mode: when it goes wrong you get a repeated
	//                frame, which is obvious.
	//
	//   1 SLIDING  - let the clip PLAY, in slow motion, advancing to each
	//                frame's mark and then exposing RenderSamples consecutive
	//                presents. THE DEFAULT.
	//
	// Sliding exists for what walking cannot do rather than to do it better. A
	// seeked frame is COLD: particle systems do not step, and anything with
	// temporal history - TAA, SSR reprojection, the RT accumulation on Enhanced -
	// is reset or wrong at every single sample. Playing the clip keeps all of
	// that coherent.
	//
	// RenderSamples and RenderShutter mean the same thing in both modes, and
	// there is nothing extra to configure: the playback speed is derived from a
	// measurement taken on the first frame.
	//
	// Sliding's shutter is APPROXIMATE - the samples land on the instants the
	// game presented rather than on exact midpoints - so walking is still the
	// one to pick when placement has to be exact, or when a sliding render comes
	// out looking wrong.
	//
	// It is NOT the slower one, which this comment claimed for a long time on
	// the reasoning that "the world has to actually run". Count the frames:
	//     walking  = RenderSettleFrames + Samples * (1 + RenderSettleSubFrames)
	//     sliding  = Samples / Shutter
	// At the shipped defaults that is 3 + 64*2 = 131 against 64, so sliding is
	// around 2x faster at a 360-degree shutter. The two are level at 180, and
	// below that walking wins.
	//
	// It said 3x for a long time - in this comment, in presetmaker's help and in
	// the export menu - directly above the formula that gives 2.05. The "level at
	// 180" claim is the tell: N/shutter == 2N only at shutter 0.5, which pins the
	// 360-degree ratio at 2. Where walking's second present goes is no mystery
	// either: one to redraw at the seeked time, one to capture it, and they
	// cannot overlap without capturing a frame the world has already left.
	// How sub-frames are gathered IN TIME: 0 Walking (seek), 1 Sliding (step).
	//
	// Depth of field used to be a third value here, and that was a category
	// error: this axis is about time, an aperture is a lens. It is why both
