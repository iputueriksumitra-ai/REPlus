// Hosts the mod will install into: singleplayer GTA V, either build, and FiveM.
//
// FiveM took three separate fixes to reach, all of them recorded here because
// each looked like the answer at the time and only the last one was:
//   * the deferred-init detour on kernel32!GetSystemTimeAsFileTime cannot be
//     placed there (MH_ERROR_MEMORY_ALLOC - no trampoline within +/-2GB of
//     kernel32 once CEF, V8 and mono are loaded), so init routes through
//     ScriptHookV instead. See main.cpp.
//   * FiveM ships its own msvcp140 (14.34) in FiveM.app\bin and the game
//     subprocess loads that rather than the system's. Built against a newer
//     toolset, the inlined STL bound to an older runtime and died on the first
//     std::mutex lock. Fixed by linking the CRT statically - see CMakeLists.
//   * fx_asi_build.rc must declare the running build id or the plugin is
//     refused outright.
//
// With those in place nothing else about FiveM needs special handling: the
// Legacy signature set resolves there unchanged.
