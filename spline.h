// =============================================================================
//  The actual fix: a real spline to replace Rockstar's lerp+lag-filter.
// =============================================================================
//  Stock "Smooth Blend" is a two-point Lerp between markers with a damped
//  spring chasing it. A spring is a causal
//  low-pass filter, so it trails the target and undershoots every corner —
//  which is why the camera visibly misses markers and feels laggy.
//
//  Catmull-Rom fixes both properties at once: it passes exactly through its
//  control points and is a pure function of t (no state, so scrubbing
//  backwards gives the identical path — stock disables smoothing entirely
//  when rewinding precisely because a spring cannot run in reverse).
//
//  Alpha (the menu's "Spline Tension") picks the knot spacing: 0 uniform,
//  0.5 centripetal, 1.0 chordal. It DEFAULTS TO 1.0 - see Config::alpha, which
//  is the authority and carries the current reasoning. Not the textbook answer,
//  and deliberate.
//
//  It also only reaches the camera under Continuous or Per Segment pacing. The
//  shipping default is Natural, where the path is hermitePos over marker TIMES
//  and there is no knot spacing to parameterise - alpha still feeds
//  segmentLength, so it moves the debug log's `bow` figure and nothing visible.
//
//  Centripetal is normally recommended because it provably never cusps or
//  self-intersects (Yuksel et al., "Parameterization and Applications of
//  Catmull-Rom Curves") - but that theorem is about a curve within ONE segment,
//  and the failure it prevents is overshoot between well-spaced control points.
//  It buys that by shortening the tangent wherever a neighbouring chord is
//  short, and at a direction REVERSAL that is exactly backwards: a short
//  tangent leaves the curve no momentum to sweep around, so it pokes past the
//  marker and hooks back across its own path. Measured on a real shot with a
//  160-degree reversal, arc length over chord around the marker:
//
//      alpha 0.00 -> 1.11       alpha 0.50 -> 1.56       alpha 1.00 -> 3.59
//
//  i.e. the guarantee holds and is protecting against the wrong thing. Hand
//  placed camera markers reverse direction constantly; they are rarely the
//  smooth monotone polylines the theorem has in mind.
//
//  Lower alpha per marker where a shot wants to flow wide through its marks,
//  higher where it should be held tight to them. Measured on a 10 m straight
//  into a 45-degree turn, the deviation of the "straight" leg from the line
//  between its own two markers:
//
//      alpha 0.00 -> 0.74 m     alpha 0.50 -> 0.57 m     alpha 1.00 -> 0.43 m
//
//  Uniform also matches the sibling Simple Camera project, whose Hermite is
//  parameterised by TIME - with roughly even marker spacing that IS uniform
//  Catmull-Rom, which is likewise what Natural pacing here reduces to.

	//
	// Evaluating this way (rather than the uniform basis-matrix form) is what

	// uniform, 0.5 centripetal, 1.0 chordal.

	// Uniform cubic B-spline over the same four control points.
	//
	// APPROXIMATING, not interpolating: it does not pass through p1 or p2, it
	// leans toward them and gets carried past. That miss is the point. The
	// cubic B-spline basis IS the fourfold convolution of a box function, so
	// this is literally a low-pass filter applied to the control polygon - the
	// lagged, heavy version of the same path. It buys the feel of a damped
	// spring chasing the markers while staying a pure function of t, which a
	// spring is not: a stateful smoother would be unreproducible across a
	// re-render, and would converge to the unlagged path when a renderer holds
	// the playhead still - which is the failure mode we are avoiding, not one
	// to reintroduce.
	//
	// Uniform by construction, so alpha has no analogue here and is not taken.
	// Blending a centripetal Catmull-Rom against a uniform B-spline is fine -
	// both are cubics over p0..p3 and t means the same thing in both.
	// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// The four cubic B-spline weights, NON-UNIFORM - de Boor over the real
	// knot spacing k[0..3], evaluated at u inside the span [k1,k2].
	//
	// A UNIFORM basis was the first attempt and it kicked at every keyframe.
	// The basis is C2 in its own parameter, but that parameter is normalised
	// per segment, so d(param)/d(time) is 1/segmentDuration and STEPS at each
	// marker whenever two segments differ in length. Position stayed continuous
	// - both sides evaluate (p1+4p2+p3)/6 - while VELOCITY did not. It scaled
	// with the weight because the Catmull-Rom term buries it until the B-spline
	// term dominates, which is why it only showed at Heavy and Full.
	//
	// Centripetal alpha solves this for Catmull-Rom; the uniform basis had no
	// equivalent. de Boor takes the knots themselves, so the time derivative is
	// continuous by construction at any weight.
	//
	// The pyramid is run on the COEFFICIENTS rather than on points, so one
	// function serves position, FOV and orientation and they cannot disagree.
	// k6 = the SIX knots a cubic span needs, in order, with the span itself
	// between k6[2] and k6[3]. The caller supplies the outer two because only it
	// knows whether a real neighbour exists.
	//
	// They used to be MIRRORED in here, and that was the second keyframe artefact:
	// the outer knots influence the span endpoints, and adjacent windows reflect
	// DIFFERENT ones - marker n is reached once via a knot reflected past its
	// right neighbour and once via one reflected past its left. Two fabricated
	// values for the same instant, so the two sides of the marker disagreed and
	// Full jumped. With real neighbours both windows use the same four spacings
	// around the shared marker and land on the same point.

	// in the middle of the clip but not at the start".
	//
	// The standard cure is the natural end condition, C''= 0 at the endpoint,
	// which is what a draughtsman's spline does when it is not clamped. Solving

	// the far end (m1 = (P2 - P0)/2) gives

	// equal distance.

	// piecewise constant and steps once per sample - a speed ripple at
	// SAMPLES-per-segment. At 16 that is a handful of steps per second on a
	// slow move, which is inside the range the eye picks up as roughness; 32
	// halves the step size for ~30 extra curve evaluations a frame, which is
	// nothing next to a replay frame.
	//
	// Endpoints are preserved exactly, so marker timing is untouched — this
	// only redistributes *within* the segment.
