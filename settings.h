// =============================================================================
//  Per-marker settings
// =============================================================================
//  sReplayMarkerInfo is a fixed 0xB8 struct serialised straight into .clip
//  files - there is nowhere to put our own fields without breaking the format
//  Rockstar's own loader validates. So settings live in a side-car file, one per
//  project, keyed inside it by (clip identity, the marker's non-dilated time
//  at +0x70).
//
//  Why time is half the key: the editor refuses two markers at the same time
//  within a clip, so it is unique there, and unlike an index it survives markers
//  being added or removed earlier in the timeline. It does NOT survive dragging
//  a marker, which is why rekey() exists.
//
//  Why the clip is the other half: time alone is unique per clip, not per
//  project. Two clips with a marker at the same moment shared one entry, so a
//  setting made in one appeared on the other - and with a single shared file,
//  on every other project as well.
//
//  Numeric overrides live in one flat array rather than named members. They all
//  mean the same thing (-1 = inherit the global), they are all edited by the
//  same menu code, and they all serialise identically - so adding a knob is one
//  enum entry instead of a change in four places.
// =============================================================================
