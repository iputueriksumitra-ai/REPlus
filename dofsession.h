// =============================================================================
//  Accumulated depth-of-field sessions, driven from ReShade
// =============================================================================
//  The capture add-on we already require for rendering also contains a
//  depth-of-field controller: it walks the camera around a lens aperture, one
//  step per frame, and blends the results in its own shader. That produces real
//  optical bokeh rather than a screen-space approximation.
//
//  It has always been dead weight here, because it drives the camera through
//  the IGCS camera-tools interface and nothing in the process implements that
//  while the Rockstar Editor is up. The add-on finds camera tools by walking the
//  loaded modules and taking the first one that exports
//  IGCS_StartScreenshotSession - it does not care WHICH module that is, and an
//  .asi is a module like any other. So implementing four functions is the whole
//  integration.
//
//  THE SHUTTER. By default a session integrates one frozen instant: every
//  sample is the same moment from a different point on the lens, so the only
//  thing varying is the aperture. That is the right answer for a locked-off
//  shot and it is what an add-on that knows nothing about the extension gets.
//
//  When the add-on drives the timed entry point, the clock is stepped per
//  sample too and one pass produces depth of field AND motion blur.
//
//  THE SHUTTER IS THE ADD-ON'S, ENTIRELY - there is no setting on this side and
//  deliberately no fallback. Placing samples in an exposure needs the sample
//  COUNT and the aperture ring each point came from, and neither is knowable
//  here: the total is never reported over the interface. Anything this side
//  could invent from a running index alone would be worse, and would need
//  guessing at when a burst had started to avoid walking the clock during
//  setup. The add-on has both facts already.
//
//  An earlier attempt at this was removed for looking wrong, and the reasons
//  are worth recording because none of them was the idea itself:
//
//    * Time advanced monotonically with the sample index, and the index runs
//      centre-outward through the aperture rings - so time was CORRELATED with
//      radius, and a moving object's trail came out as a radial sweep, tight
//      bokeh at one end and wide at the other. The add-on now stratifies the
//      interval and shuffles it against the point order.
//    * Setup moves were stepped as well, so dragging the bokeh-size slider
//      walked the clock forward with no way back. Gone with the running index:
//      each sample now carries its own absolute offset from t0.
//    * The blend can run before the seek has landed, which puts the previous
//      sample's instant into the accumulator and reads as a clean double image.
//      That one is not fixable here - it is Frames To Wait in the add-on's own
//      panel - so it is detected and named in the log instead of hidden.
//
//  The camera is deliberately NOT pinned while the clock moves: the spline
//  re-evaluates and carries it along its path, so a moving shot blurs as a
//  whole. The add-on's alignment cancels the aperture's parallax only, which is
//  exactly right - the aperture is the lens, the spline is the camera body, and
//  only the first is supposed to leave the focus plane sharp.
//
//  THREADING. Everything the add-on calls arrives on ReShade's present thread.
//  Seeking the replay and writing the camera are main-thread-only, for the same
//  reason render::pump() exists. So the exported functions record intent and
//  return; pump() and applyToFrame() do the work from the UpdateSmoothing
//  detour. The add-on's own frame-wait covers the one-frame latency this adds.
