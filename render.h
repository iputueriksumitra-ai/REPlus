// =============================================================================
//  Image-sequence renderer
// =============================================================================
//  Renders the clip to a numbered PNG/JPEG sequence through the capture
//  channel, one output frame at a time. No ffmpeg, no encoder, no dependency on
//  the game's own exporter - which also means no watermark and no profanity
//  gate, because that pipeline is never entered.
//
//  WHY THIS IS EXACT, unlike the free-roam version of the same idea. Simple
//  Camera has no seekable clock, so it chases a moving playhead with
//  SET_TIME_SCALE slow motion and a self-correcting controller, and lives with
//  the overshoot. The Rockstar Editor has a real timeline: we pause playback
//  and JUMP to start + frame*dt. Sub-samples are jumps to t + k*(dt*shutter/N).
//  The shutter is therefore mathematically exact, there is no drift to correct,
//  and wall-clock speed does not affect the result at all.
//
//  WHY IT IS A STATE MACHINE and not a loop. We have no ScriptHookV, so there
//  is no WAIT(0) to yield on. Instead pump() is called once per frame from the
//  UpdateSmoothing detour - the game's main thread, which is the only thread
//  where jumping the replay is safe - and each call advances one step. "A frame
//  was presented" is read from the addon's heartbeat.
// =============================================================================
