// =============================================================================
//  Video output — the finished frames, streamed into ffmpeg
// =============================================================================
//  The renderer already produces exactly the frames a video wants: paused
//  playback, an exact seek per sub-sample, and the addon accumulating them into
//  one output frame. All that was ever missing is an encoder on the end.
//
//  This does NOT change how frames are captured. The addon still writes
//  frame_%06d.png; we hand each completed one to ffmpeg's stdin and delete it.
//  Two consequences worth stating, because they are why this shape was chosen:
//
//    * NO ADDON CHANGES. The shared-memory protocol, the accumulation and the
//      highlight boost all stay exactly as they are - which matters, because
//      that half is the part that already works on both game builds.
//    * NO DISK BLOW-UP. Frames are consumed as they appear rather than piling
//      up, so a ten-minute render costs a couple of files at a time instead of
//      eighteen thousand.
//
//  It is deliberately a child process rather than linked libavcodec: no new
//  build dependency, the encoder is swappable from the ini, and an ffmpeg that
//  dies cannot take the game with it.
// =============================================================================
